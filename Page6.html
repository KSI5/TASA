<h3>GENERAL PROCEDURES AT THE HEARING OF A CHARGE OF MISCONDUCT</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the interest of transparency, all hearings are open meetings unless the Chairperson of the SDC is persuaded by the circumstances of the case to direct that the hearing be closed to the University community.</li><br>
  <li>The initiator leads evidence against the accused student and generally conducts the case for the University.</li><br>
  <li>The SDC allows the student or such person representing the student a reasonable opportunity to present a defence and to answer the charges</li><br>
  <li>Both the initiator and the accused student are allowed to adduce all relevant evidence and call witnesses and to examine and cross-examine witnesses, as appropriate.</li><br>
  <li>The SDC may also ask the witnesses questions for clarity.</li><br>
  <li>The SDC may further, of its own accord, call for evidence that it may deem relevant to determine the issue(s) before it.</li><br>
  <li>The hearing of the SDC is conducted in an informal manner, according to the principles of natural justice and with due regard for the rights of the accused student.  No accused student will be prejudiced by reason of a failure to comply with the rules of procedure or rules of evidence as applied in the ordinary courts.</li><br>
  <li>If the student is a minor, no disciplinary action(s) will be taken against that student before his/her parent or guardian has also been informed in writing of his/her alleged misconduct
and has been given a proper opportunity to make a written statement and, if he/she so wishes, to appear before the SDC in person.</li>
