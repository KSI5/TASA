<h3>SANCTIONS</h3>
<ol>
  <li>When considering an appropriate sanction, the SDC takes account of all mitigating and aggravating factors presented during the hearing.   Further, when considering the appropriateness of the disciplinary measures to be imposed, the SDC ensures that such disciplinary measures are, as far as possible, appropriate to and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the misconduct of which the student has been found guilty.  And still further, it is noted that the SDC is also bound by the rules of administrative law and natural justice and the principles of precedent</li>
  <br>

<li>After finding a student guilty of misconduct, the SDC may impose one or more of the following sanctions:<ol><br>

  <li>revocation of a degree, diploma or other qualification obtained from the University in an improper manner;
  </li><br>
  <li>	a written reprimand and/or warning;</li><br>
