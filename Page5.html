<h3>PROCEDURE IN THE CASE OF A COMPLAINT OF MISCONDUCT</h3>
<ol>
  <li class="bold">NOTIFICATION OF MISCONDUCT</li><br>
  <p>A student will not be formally charged with misconduct until a written and signed statement containing an accusation, complaint or allegation made against the student has been submitted to the Registrar or a person authorised by him/her to receive such complaint, provided that nothing contained herein will prpromotion the Registrar from laying a complaint of misconduct against a student</p>


  <li><strong>PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION</strong><ol>
    <li>The Registrar appoints one or more persons to conduct a preliminary investigation into an accusation, complaint or allegation brought to his/her attention. The Registrar may, at his/her discretion, conduct the investigation him/herself.</li><br>
    <li>Such person(s) so appointed submits a written report and/or charge sheet to the
Registrar.
</li><br>
<li>The person(s) appointed to conduct the preliminary investigation may consult with or obtain information from any person, including the student against whom the accusation, complaint or allegation has been made</li>
</ol>
</li><br>
<li><strong>REFERRAL TO THE STUDENT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE (SDC)</strong><ol><br>

<li>If the Registrar is of the opinion that there is a prima facie case and that there are reasonable grounds for a charge of misconduct and that the misconduct is of a
serious nature, he/she drafts a written charge or has such charge drawn up to be heard by the SDC.
</li><br>
<li>If the Registrar is of the opinion that an alleged misconduct of a student constitutes a minor contravention of the Code, the Registrar may exercise his/her discretion to decide what further steps should be taken in response to the alleged misconduct.</li>
</ol>
</li><br>
  <li><strong>NOTICE TO THE ACCUSED STUDENT</strong><ol><br>
<li>When proceedings against a student are instituted in terms of paragraph 3 above, the Registrar will give the student concerned not less than fourteen calendar days’ notice in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing by the SDC.</li><br>
<li>The Notice under this rule will inform the student<ol><br>
  <li>    that proceedings under the Students’ Disciplinary Code are to be instituted against him/her and that a copy of the Code is available for inspection in the Office of the Registrar or on the University student website,</li><br>
  <li>of the Rule that the student is alleged to have breached and/or the act(s) of misconduct that the student is alleged to have committed. The Notice must set out the charge with sufficient particularity to enable the student to prepare for his/her defence,</li><br>
  <li>of his/her right to answer the charge in writing at least four calendar days before the hearing,</li><br>
  <li>of his/her right to attend the hearing to present his/her case, or to be represented at the hearing by another student, member of the Student Representative Council or an employee of the University, and </li><br>
  <li>of his/her right if he/she is a minor to be assisted by his/her parent or guardian or, at the discretion of the SDC, to be assisted by any other person appointed by such parent or guardian, provided that nothing contained in this Rule renders the conduct of the SDC void if the student is not so assisted on the date set for the hearing.</ol><br>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>SERVICE OF NOTICE</strong><ol><br>
  <li>Service of any written notice and the furnishing of particulars in terms of this Code will be by prepaid, registered post to the residential address provided either on the most recent application form completed by the student for the purpose of registration or on any later written notice submitted by the student to the University of a change of address.</li><br>
  <li>In the case of such service the student will be deemed to have received the Notice and particulars within five calendar days of the date of posting thereof.</li>
</ol>
</li><br>
<li><strong>SUSPENSION</strong><ol><br>
  <li>No student will be suspended from the University before a hearing is held. However, the Registrar may use an abridged service of Notice to convene an emergency SDC that will determine the need for a temporary suspension which will serve to prohibit such student from:<ol><br>
  <li>entering onto the premises of the University, or any part thereof, and/or</li><br>
  <li>using an opportunity resulting from his/her enrolment as a student</li>
</ol>
</li><br>
<li>A temporary suspension in terms of paragraph 6.1 remains in force for the period not exceeding thirty calendar days or until the disciplinary proceedings in terms of this Code have been completed, whichever instance may first occur.</li><br>
<li>The suspended student may make written representations to the Principal and Vice Chancellor within five calendar days of receipt of written notice of his/her suspension, advancing reasons why he/she should not be suspended.<ol><br>
  <li>The Principal and Vice Chancellor may at his/her discretion revoke a suspension at any time, provided that, notwithstanding such revocation, further steps may be taken to proceed with the disciplinary hearing on the charge of misconduct against the student.</li><br>
  <li>The Principal and Vice Chancellor may, at his/her discretion, also confirm the suspension.</li>
